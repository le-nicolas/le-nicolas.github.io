Self-help books have been a significant influence on my personal growth journey. They have provided me with the tools to become more disciplined, focused, and mindful. In this post, I want to share some of the key lessons I've learned from these books and how they've shaped my life.


### Role Models and Inspirations

Usyk: A Model of Discipline and Confidence

One of my biggest inspirations is Oleksandr Usyk, a phenomenal boxer, father, and husband. Usyk's ability to regulate himself, stay focused on his fights despite obstacles and doubts, and maintain his confidence and intelligence is truly admirable. He is also a deeply religious person, which adds another layer of strength and resilience to his character. I strive to emulate his discipline and calm under pressure in my own life.

Andrej Karpathy: The Power of Detailed Thought Process

Andrej Karpathy has also had a profound impact on me. His articulate and detailed thought process, coupled with his ability to communicate complex ideas with accuracy and precision, is something I deeply admire. Karpathy's techniques for learning and being a scientist have inspired me to adopt a more structured and effective approach to my own learning.

### Health and Fitness

Efficiency in Exercise

One crucial lesson I've learned is the importance of efficiency in exercise. There's a subtle art to lifting weights—too much lifting can make you hungry and compromise a 14-hour fast. It's essential to be strategic about fatigue, repetitions, rest ratios, and overall yearly planning to find the most optimal process for your body. i also monitor my heart rate and i take incharge of my nutrition + vitamins.

Yoga and Stretching

Incorporating yoga and stretching into my routine has been transformative. I practice yoga and stretching before exercising and before going to bed. These activities help improve flexibility, reduce the risk of injury, and promote relaxation. They also prepare my body for more intense workouts and aid in recovery afterward, ensuring that I maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

Ice Baths: A Mental Challenge

Taking an ice bath is more than just a physical challenge; it's a test of mental fortitude. Embracing the discomfort and pushing through it has taught me a lot about resilience and the power of the mind.

Listening to Your Body

Another vital lesson is the importance of listening to your body and mind. Recognizing that you are a hardworking person means understanding when to push and when to take a step back. If things aren't going your way, sometimes a less intense workout can be just as beneficial.

Daily Habits and Discipline
Making My Own Coffee

A simple yet effective habit I've adopted is making my own coffee. This allows me to control my sugar intake and start my day with a sense of accomplishment and control.

Discipline Over Motivation

I've learned that discipline is more reliable than motivation. By focusing on small, consistent actions, I've developed processes that lead to long-term success, rather than relying on fleeting bursts of motivation.

No News

Avoiding the news has been a game-changer for me. It reduces distractions and helps me stay focused on my goals and priorities.

Personal Growth and Challenges
From 80 kg to 60 kg

My weight loss journey from 80 kg to 60 kg has been transformative. Transitioning from a higher fat percentage to a lean, muscular build has not only improved my physical health but also boosted my confidence.

Training as a Fighter

I've recently started training as a fighter, exploring kickboxing, boxing, Muay Thai, and Taekwondo. The variety keeps things interesting, and I love the challenge of grounding and pounding. Jogging when the weather is fine and enjoying the benefits of sunlight and vitamin D has become a regular part of my routine.

Mindfulness and Meditation
Meditation

Meditation has become a cornerstone of my daily routine. It helps me stay centered and mindful, allowing me to navigate life's challenges with greater ease and clarity.

Managing Distractions

Being mindful of the distractions I allow into my life has been crucial. I've learned to recognize what serves my goals and what doesn't, helping me stay focused and productive.

### Social Interactions and Relationships

Interactions Based on Relationships

I've learned that social interactions should be tailored based on the level of the relationship and mutual understanding. Recognizing and respecting these dynamics leads to more meaningful and harmonious connections.

Good People Without Transactions

It's important to acknowledge and appreciate the good people who help others without expecting anything in return. This realization has helped me foster more genuine and supportive relationships.

### Personal Hobbies

Cooking and Singing

Two hobbies that bring me immense joy are cooking and singing. Cooking allows for endless creativity and experimentation, while singing provides a wonderful outlet for emotional expression.


TLDR: Self-help books have equipped me with the knowledge and inspiration to continually improve myself. By incorporating these lessons into my daily life, I've been able to achieve significant personal growth. I hope these insights inspire you to embark on your own journey of self-improvement and discover the benefits of self-help literature.
