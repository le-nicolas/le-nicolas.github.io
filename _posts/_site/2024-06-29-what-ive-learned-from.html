<p>Usyk: A Model of Discipline and Confidence</p>

<p>One of my biggest inspirations is Oleksandr Usyk, a phenomenal boxer, father, and husband. Usyk’s ability to regulate himself, stay focused on his fights despite obstacles and doubts, and maintain his confidence and intelligence is truly admirable. He is also a deeply religious person, which adds another layer of strength and resilience to his character. I strive to emulate his discipline and calm under pressure in my own life.</p>

<p>Andrej Karpathy has also had a profound impact on me.

<p>Efficiency in Exercise</p>

<p>One crucial lesson I’ve learned is the importance of efficiency in exercise. There’s a subtle art to lifting weights—too much lifting can make you hungry and compromise a 14-hour fast.

<p>Yoga and Stretching</p>

<p>Incorporating yoga and stretching into my routine has been transformative. I practice yoga and stretching before exercising and before going to bed. These activities help improve flexibility, reduce the risk of injury, and promote relaxation. They also prepare my body for more intense workouts and aid in recovery afterward, ensuring that I maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>Ice Baths: A Mental Challenge</p>

<p>Taking an ice bath is more than just a physical challenge; it’s a test of mental fortitude. Embracing the discomfort and pushing through it has taught me a lot about resilience and the power of the mind.</p>

<p>Listening to Your Body</p>

<p>Another vital lesson is the importance of listening to your body and mind. Recognizing that you are a hardworking person means understanding when to push and when to take a step back. If things aren’t going your way, sometimes a less intense workout can be just as beneficial.</p>
