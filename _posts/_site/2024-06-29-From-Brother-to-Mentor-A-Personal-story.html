<p>As a young adult suddenly responsible for the development of my younger brother due to our parents’ demanding work schedules, I found myself grappling with unexpected challenges. This role required more than just basic caregiving; it required a deep understanding of how to guide someone towards their potential. In this journey, I discovered that you don’t need to be an expert to teach someone. You just have to be the key or the bridge that allows them to learn to walk so that they can eventually run.</p>

<p>One important obstacle I learned (for which I am so grateful) is that history is full of bad jokes—misguided lives and unfulfilled potential often stem from a lack of guidance and support. I wondered: Is it because no one cared for them? Or because the world is too pressured, with everyone chasing something? These questions shaped my approach to my brother’s development.</p>

<p>Of course, I cared for their future and their life ahead. One important thing I know is to “train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it” (Proverbs 22:6). This is actually true in most cases; as time goes by, people will base what they do on inertia. So, I took this challenge and took action. I firmly believe in the value of hard work and allowing individuals to develop their own style(one important thing i notice is that they dont like to read books, so i didn’t force them there).</p>

<p>Teaching starts at the foundational level. I embraced methods and mindsets that would resonate with my brother. Inspired by Gordon Ramsay’s motto, “cheap cuts into something extraordinary,” I focused on transforming simple beginnings into exceptional outcomes. Drawing inspiration from role models like Bob Ross, I emphasized that drawing is a visual skill that can be nurtured with patience and practice. (I have two brothers, by the way.)</p>

<p>One pivotal moment was catching my brother painting on the walls using cleaning materials. Instead of reprimanding him, I praised his creativity and encouraged his artistic exploration. I learned to encourage failure as a natural part of learning, fostering a safe space where mistakes were seen as stepping stones to success. For my other brother, it was his confidence in adding starch to the dish he was making (adobo), which made me realize, “Oh, he actually reads the content and its compatibility for its flavor to be good.”</p>

<p>I also allowed my brothers to have full, immersive experiences, whether we were jogging, visiting art galleries, or dining at restaurants. Every activity was a learning opportunity, blending subjective enjoyment with objective lessons from nature and life.</p>

<p>All in all, this is easier said than done. Development takes time. You cannot rush it, and it’s important to pace the acceleration to avoid overwhelming them. Patience is key, as it allows new concepts and skills to sink in deeply and become part of their being. These methods brought a noticeable shift in my brother. He became more well-rounded, his grades improved, and he developed a love for learning from the ground up. The changes were profound and extended beyond academics; they touched every aspect of his growth.</p>

<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>

<p>Developing my brothers required a blend of guidance, encouragement, and patience. It was a journey that emphasized the importance of foundational learning, immersive experiences, and allowing for personal growth at a natural pace. This approach not only helped them grow but also enriched my own life. If you find yourself in a similar role, remember that every step, no matter how small, contributes to a significant impact over time.</p>

  <p>Helping someone discover who they truly are and expanding their horizons is one of the most rewarding experiences. It not only changes their life but also enriches yours. So, take the time to invest in those around you, and watch how it transforms both of you.</p>
